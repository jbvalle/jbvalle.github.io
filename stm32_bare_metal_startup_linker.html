                        <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1><a id="intro_reg_lev"></a>Introduction</h2>
                        Suppose you’ve ever wondered how to set up a bare metal register level C program for developing embedded systems without an IDE or libraries such as HAL or any other abstractions. In that case, this blog post is for you! First, let’s define what register-level programming is and why you would want to use this approach.</br></br>
                        Register-level programming is  low-level programming where operations are carried out directly on the hardware registers of a processor. This is in contrast to the higher-level programming approach, which is done by applying modifications using abstractions such as functions and objects. There are numerous reasons why you would want to program at the register level:</br></br></br>

                        <ol>
                            <li>First, it can be very powerful, as it provides more precise control and flexibility over the hardware</li>
                            <li>Second, it can be used to create very efficient code, since you’re not dealing with the overhead of higher-level abstractions
                            </li>
                            <li>Third, it’s necessary for circumstances where operations must be performed that otherwise would be very difficult or even impossible at a higher level</li>
                            <li>And finally, IT CAN BE MORE FUN! :)
                            </li>
                        </ol>  

                        Still it’s important to keep some disadvantages in mind using this approach:</br></br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>First, it can be very difficult to debug register level code, as it is hard to read and follow the logic of the code,
                            </li>
                            <li>Second, it can be dangerous, as it’s easy to make mistakes and even damage the hardware</li>
                        </ol>  
                        Though register level programming can be difficult as it requires proficient knowledge about the hardware, it can be very rewarding as you can get maximum out of your embedded system.</br></br>

                        To get started some requirements are:</br>
                        1. A good development board, ie. from ST, Texas Instruments or Arduino, etc. (The board used in this example is STM32F401RE)</br>
                        2. A compiler and an assembler (The compiler used in this example is arm-none-eabi-gcc source: <a href="https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain" target="_blank">Click here</a>)</br></br>

                        These tools will allow us to write and compile code. Furthermore, register-level programming also requires knowledge of how to use bitwise operations. Bitwise operators perform bit-level modifications to integer-type values. Those operators are AND, OR, and XOR, which can be used to set, clear, toggle or invert individual bits. These operators can be very powerful, but also somewhat confusing. The following section provides a quick overview of the most important applications of these operators.</br></br>

                        The GNU Toolchain is a collection of programming tools produced by the GNU Project. It’s used to turn source code into executables.It is a powerful tool that is completely free and highly portable. It includes the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), the GNU Debugger (GDB), and further binaries and tools that are well-maintained.</br>
                        The ARM GNU Toolchain is a collection of these tools specialized for ARM - Chips. The flow diagram below illustrates how the ARM-GNU Toolchain compiles source files into a finished executable.</br>

                        There are multiple ways for debugging and flashing the finished executable onto the chip, however, in this example, the free open-source on-chip debugger OpenOCD is used. The following flow diagram illustrates how OpenOCD flashes and debugs the executable on the chip.</br>

                        The purpose of the linker script is to link together various pieces of code and data to form a complete executable. Its role is to provide the necessary runtime environment for the system to function properly. In order to write a linker script the GNU linker script language is used, which is actually a subset of the C programming language.</br></br>
                        The linker itself is a program integrated in the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which utilizes the linker script to determine how to map the contents of an executable file into memory. It controls the memory layout of an executable, including where in memory the executable’s code and data are placed. Additionally, it controls the linking process itself.
A Linker Script contains multiple sections, the memory section the define various memories in the systems and their attributes. The attribute of a memory includes its size, its starting address, its type and its reading permissions. The actual documentation for those sections can be looked up in the official GNU Documentation. A snippet of the documentation describing the memory section is provided in the following image.</br></br>
