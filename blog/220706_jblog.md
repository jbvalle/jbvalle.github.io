## Tools for creating a project

### Build Automation Tools [^1]
Build Automation Tools like Makefile/CMake are commonly used for C/C++ Projects. However due to the Java Compiler beeing much slower than the gcc compiler and because projects in java tend to organize files as groups of files in directories, vs C usually tend towards flatter structures, Makefiles didn't have much direct support to working with hiearchies of files. Therefore needing more optimized build tools were needed like:
- Ant
- Maven 
- Grade
- etc.

These tools would sum up all the files that were out of date, and compile them in one go, rather than compile them individually, therefore speeding up the build process for the much slower java compiler. Additionally they would act as a dependency-management tool for java.

### Ant
It stands for "Another Neat Tool" and was specifically designed for the java ecosystem. Its build file is a build.xml file, unlike Make, which had Makefiles.

### Grade
Grade is based on Ant and Maven. It uses build.gradle files for its build process. And its main feature difference is the much smaller configuration file footprint.

### Apache Maven
Maven is currently the most common build tool and dependency manager today for java. Its build file is called pom.xml.
Features are a build in built-framework:
- It containes build instructions
- dependency management instructions
- No need to define build phases, these are handled by built-in commands like `maven compile`
